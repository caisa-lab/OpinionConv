# OpinionConv: Conversational Product Search with Grounded Opinions

When searching for products, the subjective experiences of others can be a valuable source of information. This is also true in conversational product search, where a customer and a sales assistant exchange facts and opinions about products. However, training an AI for such conversations is complicated by the fact that language models do not possess authentic opinions because of the lack of real-world experience.

With OpinionConv, we develop the first conversational system to simulate sales conversations by leveraging product reviews to ground conversational AI in true subjective narratives.

OpinionConv enables researchers to study a number of tasks related to conversational product search, including opinionated conversation modeling and opinionated response generation and selection. For more information, refer to the following paper:
